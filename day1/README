## What You Will Learn
- How to create a basic HTML document with headings, lists, and links
- How to structure the content using HTML5
- How to use common attributes like `href` and `src`

## Exercise
1. Create a new HTML file (`index.html`) and copy the structure above.
2. Modify the page by adding:
   - A second heading using `<h2>`.
   - Two additional links with meaningful descriptions.
   - An ordered list with at least three items.

Once done, open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the page!
