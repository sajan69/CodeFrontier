# Day 18: Advanced React Hooks in DevHive

## Today's Implementation
We're adding advanced React hooks functionality to DevHive, focusing on performance optimization and complex state management.

## Features Added
1. **Project Feed (useMemo)**
   - Optimized project filtering and sorting
   - Cached computation of project statistics
   - Smart re-rendering management

2. **Real-time Collaboration (useReducer)**
   - Complex state management for collaboration features
   - Team member status tracking
   - Project updates synchronization

3. **Analytics Dashboard (useCallback)**
   - Optimized event handlers
   - Performance metrics calculation
   - Data visualization callbacks

4. **Search System (useTransition)**
   - Concurrent rendering for search results
   - Smooth UI transitions
   - Prioritized user interactions

## Code Changes
- Added ProjectFeed component with useMemo
- Implemented CollaborationHub with useReducer
- Created AnalyticsDashboard with useCallback
- Enhanced search with useTransition
